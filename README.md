# Remix.Gun Boilerplate

![Remix/Gun](public/github/rmix-gun.png 'Remix.Gun')

This is my white-label boilerplate when building full stack apps. Using GunDB, SEA authentication and React v18. Out of the box two or more boilerplate instances can share data via GUN's peer websocket feature.

## Goals

- [x] Remix.GUN Relay Server Adapter
- [x] Authorization with Gun.Sea/ Gun User Api
- [x] Data Encrytion
- [x] Data Compression
- [x] React Concurrent Features
- [x] Docker Swarm Production Deployment

## Learning Moments

## Demo

Visit the [Demo](https://rmx-gun.fltngmmth.com). In another window visit the [Peer](https://rmx-gun-peer.fltngmmth.com). In the first window use the object builder form by entering the key and value. Refresh the peer window to find your mutation.

## Development

Start the Remix development asset server.

```sh
yarn dev
```

## It works but it's still in development. Not production ready.
