## Learning Moments

## Demo

Visit the [Demo](https://remix-gun.fltngmmth.com). In another window visit the [Peer](https:/dev.cnxt.app). In the first window use the object builder form by entering the key and value. Refresh the peer window to find your mutation. It works but it's still in development.

## Development

Start the Remix development asset server.

```sh
yarn dev
```
